# mons cloud operations

Run commands from the repository root. See the repository [architecture and command map](../README.md) for package boundaries and the [Cloudflare deployment guide](../scripts/deploy-cloudflare.md) for API release and maintenance procedures.

Firebase Auth remains active. Realtime Database retains active invites and match synchronization. The API Worker owns manual invite, join, match creation, and rematch mutations; auth; profile and leaderboard reads; profile customization; username mutation; mining; gameplay; D1-backed events and prizes; profile-link catch-up; profile-game projection; event control and progress Workflows; X callback; event Telegram projection; and Worker-backed Telegram delivery.

`mons-link-profiles` D1 permanently contains the canonical profile, ownership, auth, recovery, rating, wager, and transaction-guard tables. `PROFILE_DB.profile_login_owners` is the sole source for Worker login UID to canonical profile ownership, including merge-target resolution. There is no alternate profile store or fallback; an unreadable or corrupt ownership topology fails closed with `503 profile-ownership-unavailable`.

Firebase custom `profileId` claims and RTDB `players/{uid}/profile` links are non-authoritative compatibility shadows. They remain only for browser Realtime Database Security Rules, claim and link recovery, missing-profile cleanup, and malformed profile-link outbox recovery. Worker authorization and canonical projection ownership never fall back to either shadow.

Ownership-dependent operations use one D1 snapshot for each authorization decision. A merge committed after that snapshot does not abort an RTDB write already in progress; later operations and projections observe the merged owner, while D1 rating and wager effects converge safely. Event synchronization fails closed before creating a new invite or prize assignment when participant owners already converge.

The browser resolves login-linked profile presentation only through the authenticated profile API. Invite role and write ownership come from the authenticated gameplay API using canonical D1 ownership; browser code must not read or subscribe to `players/{uid}/profile`.

Historical rematch snapshots are read through the public Worker endpoint and stored immutably in `mons-link-profile-games` D1. Rated snapshots take precedence over transition and legacy-backfill snapshots. D1 is the sole public-history source; there is no RTDB read-through or backfill path. Active match synchronization remains in RTDB.

Event records, participants, prize selections, visible prize assignments, progress markers, and event-specific projection state live exclusively in `mons-link-events` D1 after activation. Browser event subscriptions poll authenticated Worker snapshots; RTDB has no event mirror.

Event-prize withdrawal ownership, leases, persisted Solana submissions, and completion records live exclusively in `mons-link-event-prize-withdrawals` D1. RTDB has no withdrawal shadow.

Withdrawal storage must be frozen before an operator terminates a withdrawal Workflow. Resuming storage to `d1` explicitly authorizes retained terminated instances to be recreated from their durable D1 state.

## Canonical profile maintenance

The canonical writer control has two states: `active` and `frozen`. Freeze is the operator stop for schema maintenance and incidents; resume re-enables writes. In `frozen`, HTTP mutations return `503 profile-writes-disabled` with `Retry-After: 60`, profile Queue messages retry without acknowledgement, and profile sweeps pause. Auth-state expiry, game-receipt cleanup, and unrelated delivery work continue.

```sh
npm run manage:profile-canonical -- --status
npm run manage:profile-canonical -- --freeze
npm run manage:profile-canonical -- --resume
```

Freeze before applying a profile schema migration, record a D1 Time Travel bookmark, validate the schema and foreign keys, then resume only after the production smoke passes. `AUTH_MUTATIONS_DISABLED` remains an independent auth-maintenance switch.

## Setup

```sh
npm ci
npm ci --prefix cloud/functions
npm ci --prefix cloud/admin
```

The Realtime Database emulator requires Java 21 or newer. Its rules cover active gameplay; canonical event-data paths are retired.

## Firebase rule releases

Preview the complete release without starting a Firebase process:

```sh
npm run deploy:firebase -- --project mons-link --dry-run
```

Deploy Realtime Database rules:

```sh
npm run deploy:firebase -- --project mons-link
```

The Firebase configuration contains only active-gameplay Realtime Database rules. Review the dry-run first; the release helper cannot create Firestore, Hosting, Cloud Functions, or event resources.

## Event storage maintenance

`mons-link-events` uses explicit `firebase`, `frozen`, and `d1` storage modes for migration, followed by `d1` and `frozen` only after activation:

```sh
npm run manage:events -- --status
npm run manage:events -- --freeze
npm run manage:events -- --return-to-firebase
npm run manage:events -- --activate-d1
npm run manage:events -- --resume-d1
```

The import tool supports `--preview`, `--stage`, and `--final`. Final import requires event, canonical-profile, and withdrawal storage to be frozen with no active event or projection leases. It preserves all event statuses, prize selections, visible assigned prizes, scheduled progress, and event projection recovery markers. Event status reports D1 lease rows as `d1ActiveLeases`; before cutover, the final migration separately checks RTDB event and projection leases. If status reports an expired write admission after its request has finished, recover only that named row with `npm run manage:events -- --recover-stale-admission <admission-id>`. Pending cross-store transitions remain fenced and retry automatically; fix their underlying code or dependency failure forward instead of detaching or dead-lettering them. Successful transition receipts are immutable coordination evidence retained in `eventTransitionReceipts`. See the deployment guide for the ordered cutover and explicit post-smoke Firebase deletion.

## Auth maintenance and recovery

`AUTH_MUTATIONS_DISABLED` in `cloud/workers/api/wrangler.jsonc` remains an independent auth maintenance switch. Change and release it as reviewed Worker configuration; do not create environment-specific copies or Dashboard overrides.

Auth intents and X redirect flows are stored in the `mons-link-auth-state` D1 database through `AUTH_STATE_DB`. Firebase Auth remains active. Auth-state D1 is consume-once and revision-fenced. After a one-hour grace, the Worker schedule removes expired created/processing rows and compacts obsolete proof material; verified/completed/failed replays are retained for 30 days. Do not manually edit or delete active rows.

`mons-link-auth-recovery` is the permanent recovery Queue. Its consumer applies `authRecoveryJobs` idempotently, and the scheduled sweep re-enqueues stale jobs. Investigate a stuck job without purging the Queue or deleting its job record.

## Profile-game projection recovery

`mons-link-profile-game-projection` permanently owns rating, manual invite, automatch, event, and profile-link projections. Manual game-session mutations use per-invite leases and UUID receipts, then atomically persist their source writes and the historically named `profileGameProjectionOutbox/automatch/{inviteId}` marker. Producers persist durable markers before enqueueing, and the five-minute Worker schedule repairs and re-enqueues stale markers while request fencing preserves newer work and recoverable cleanup owners. The same schedule removes game-session mutation receipts after seven days.

Investigate stuck work through Queue consumption, pending marker age, and projection logs. Do not purge the Queue, delete a pending outbox, manually delete profile documents, or manually rewrite canonical profile-event prizes.

## Telegram recovery and announcements

Event Telegram projection runs through `mons-link-telegram-projection`. Every supported API or Workflow mutation writes `telegramProjectionOutbox/event/{eventId}` and increments `eventTelegramProjectionGenerations/{eventId}` atomically with the event update. The five-minute Worker schedule recovers pending markers; direct Firebase client event writes are disabled.

Restore the protected Queue bridge credential only when needed:

```sh
umask 077
firebase functions:secrets:access TELEGRAM_QUEUE_BRIDGE_SECRET --project mons-link > /secure/telegram-queue-bridge-secret
```

The Queue bridge and announcement bridge are separate credentials.

Delivery and recovery records live in the `mons-link-telegram` D1 database. Ambiguous sends remain `uncertain` and are never retried automatically. Preview and execute one reviewed recovery action through the signed Worker command endpoint:

```sh
npm run recover:telegram -- --message-key <key> --action confirm-send-absent --bridge-secret-file /secure/telegram-queue-bridge-secret
npm run recover:telegram -- --message-key <key> --action confirm-send-absent --bridge-secret-file /secure/telegram-queue-bridge-secret --execute
```

Use `confirm-send-applied --message-id <telegram-message-id>` when Telegram created the message, or `abandon` to retain the audit record and stop delivery.

Send a confirmed event-prize announcement with an explicit event and collection name:

```sh
npm run announceEventPrizes -- <event-id> "<collection-name>"
```

The command reads only `TELEGRAM_ANNOUNCEMENT_BRIDGE_SECRET` through the pinned Firebase CLI after confirmation. It never reads the Telegram bot token or chat ID.

An uncertain Telegram response requires checking the group before retrying.

## Other admin tools

Canonical profile admin readers require an explicit `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` scoped to Account D1 Read for `mons-link-profiles`. They accept `frozen` and `active` and never use the Wrangler login token. Use a separate read-only operator token supplied through the process environment; do not place it in arguments or logs.

List profile addresses:

```sh
npm --prefix cloud/admin start -- --out-eth /secure/eth-addresses.txt --out-sol /secure/sol-addresses.txt
```

At least one output path is required. Address exports create new mode-`0600` files and refuse to overwrite an existing path; stdout contains counts only.

Publish GP, MP, or shooting-star leaderboard messages through the Queue bridge:

```sh
node cloud/admin/topGpWithEmojis.js 25 --bridge-secret-file /secure/telegram-queue-bridge-secret
node cloud/admin/topMpWithEmojis.js 25 --bridge-secret-file /secure/telegram-queue-bridge-secret
npm --prefix cloud/admin run shooting:alert -- --bridge-secret-file /secure/telegram-queue-bridge-secret --project mons-link
```
